I had to turn it around for him quickly, but it is a slow process. He also submitted the week 3 file, but I didn't have time to do this before his appointment.

### Internship Program

* Hosted Skye for an Ecampus tour and a review of her term project in person. Took her to lunch. She spent some time with Kate, and EJ who gave her a tour of the studio and demoed the Lightboard.
* Chris and Julie asked if she could come to the next ID2ID meeting, to share their progress on the ID Design library. I told them that she should work during finals week. She wanted to come, so I ensured she knew it was not compulsory. I did not hold a meeting with her, so that she didn't go over hours. She plans to come back next term for 3 credits, which Chris is happy about.
* Sent out requests to mentors for feedback on interns during Fall term.

### Sr. ID Responsibilities

* Met with Sr ID team to discuss 2024 facilitation plan. Facilitators will be responsible for recruiting contributors during their months. We will watch for conference attendance, blog posts, etc that are worth sharing. Have a list of a few things to discuss with IDs
