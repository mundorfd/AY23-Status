## Notes

 
- 2023-08-09 Karen Watte: Deborah,  Thanks so much for your presentation today as part of our summer showcase – and for helping out as my back-up host in the zoom room today too.  I’m impressed that you’ve been able to continue to engage so affirmatively with Alina over the last several years, even with the bumps in the media development process that were happening with her courses. I think the solution you presented today leveraging StoryMaps that are shared through a custom media piece will be very effective for student learning.  I imagine this approach could be used in a number of other courses in other disciplines as well.  Thanks!  
- 2023-07-13 Laurie Kirkner: I wanted to mention that your continued work to draft samples and suggestions related to our AI Council work has been very strong and a significant contribution to the team’s end goals. Thank you for what you’ve been contributing; I know that you and Nadia had a tough ask to wrangle
- As of yesterday, the many resources that the AI Council developed this past summer are live on our Ecampus website!  I appreciate the energy everyone put into this project, especially at the end of August through final review/editing, and for Ian’s work this past weekend in setting everything up on the website.  You will begin to see some of these resources shared more broadly in communications, trainings, and webinars throughout this month. The main landing page is here: [Artificial Intelligence Tools – Faculty Support | Oregon State Ecampus | OSU Degrees Online](https://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/faculty/artificial-intelligence-tools/)  You will find links to all of our resources on this page as well. I want to extend a very sincere ‘thank you’ for the hard work that each of you gave to this effort. Thanks for your persistence on a project that was rapidly evolving and for being willing to take some risks innovating in a space that is not yet well-defined. The resources that this group created puts us in a very good place in terms of guiding our work in course development this year and effectively guiding faculty in making decisions about the use of AI in their courses this year. Job well done, everyone!
