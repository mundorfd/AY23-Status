# 2023-10-13 Status Update

## Course Development Projects

### W24

#### AEC 250

* I have created a PDF form-based assignment. They would like to experience it as a student first and then as an instructor. Reached out to AT, expecting to hear back on Monday. (Wei Wei was out)

#### CH 332

* Worked with Jeff on migrating existing questions from quizzes in the old site, to question banks in a new site. A somewhat complex process, and we wanted to set up an easy-to-understand naming convention and means of growing them in the future. The current state of quizzes is a mess. After meeting and deciding on a plan, made a student worker request for help: [S24 - CH 332: Convert Quiz Questions to Question Banks - Asana](https://app.asana.com/0/1205644311119981/1205683250189952)
* Clarified delivery vs offering. He seemed to hint that we could extend this...should understand now.
* Shared information about submitting new course proposals.

#### CS 493

* No activity this week

#### CEM 372

Amalesh has made decent progress on content development, but it is complex. He is pulling information from three existing courses, in addition to module content he is providing outside of Canvas.

Because of this, he has brought lots of problematic content (accessibility and content specific to in-person versions of those classes) to our studio site. This included several dozen PDF files, many of which were images of hand-drawn graphs, equation solutions, etc. He also wanted to use several pre-existing labs from multiple classes, that also had accessibility issues and referred to face to face specific instructions (cleaning equipment, etc). Didn't want the Ecampus students to feel left out using virtual labs. We met for two hours going through all the module files and identifying remaining actions. Most of the PDFs with the hand written content can be removed. After the meeting I took a stab at reworking the labs:

##### Lab Conversion to Markdown

* Converted one of five lab exercises to Markdown format. We need to improve accessibility, portability, and editing speed. He needs slightly different versions of these files for different courses but hasn't customized them. (the refer to the face-to-face class, the course name is slightly different, etc.)
* Converted tables that were images into HTML
* Shared the `.md` file and a PDF render with the instructor.
* Provided Markdown Guidance for Amalesh to review and consider to support making existing lab documents accessible.
* Identified issues for review in the lab exercise, e.g., unclear instructions, textbook references.
* Offered to assist in converting remaining labs (but after the other content is built. This took ~ 2.5 hours)

### S24

#### BDS 599

* Wrote Brian and scheduled intake.

#### CS 201

* Prepared for and held intake. We discussed the DOC, his media needs and possible design of a ChatGPT aided assignment. Also went through existing course, to see what was working and he wanted to keep. (That was the first CS course designed on their template, and I worked with Chris Scaffidi to create it)

#### CH 123

* Prepared for and conducted Intake meeting.
* Reviewed course proposal and noted instructor's interest in multimedia-based active learning.
* Created a [document detailing multimedia ideas for CH 123](https://oregonstate.box.com/s/ehf7jdbj2feqs71nbwluz0ngiwvvgg9q), including the media types the Ecampus team can develop.
* Listed [H5P interactive activities](https://oregonstate.box.com/s/jp4qqp615gz7mcv0qh8l96djzi4xp640) (e.g., quizzes, drag-and-drop, flashcards) that can be embedded in Canvas.
* Provided links to two board game ideas, "[Chemistry Monopoly](https://oregonstate.box.com/s/mota71w66ppjkyvlg785tykva3j82tj3)" and "[Electrochemistry Catan](https://oregonstate.box.com/s/pl5x1ng7uxeqbxw1k3iulkdfpmqi7xff)," along with detailed rules and objectives.
* Clarified that complex media requests depend on team capacity and request specificity.
* Marita Barth recorded 79 lectures for a CH 123 course with us previously. This course is under redevelopment. She plans to re-use much of the content but will need to make updates, such as removing references to a textbook she no longer uses and adding subchapters. As a starting point, she is hoping to get the transcripts. Asked Ecampus Faculty Support if we could help with this.
* Submitted Lecture and Video requests

#### SOC 280

- Scheduled intake, will take place Tuesday

#### CS 499 (CS 435)

- Schedule Intake, will take place Wednesday

#### NSE 515

- Discussion with Laurie/Camille re: extension. 

### Support for F23 Courses

* CS 162H: Tim wanted to update H5P activities that were used in the CS 162 site. Added him to the existing site, walked through how to update those activities.

## Non-Course Projects

### Faculty Communications Manual

New or updated this week:

### H5P Admin

* Added Skye to Kate's Soil class H5P site. Figured out how to enable LaTex in her activities (she pointed me to the library!).
* Installed the Mathematical Expressions Library to the H5P site.
* Created an example using H5P.
* Demoed to the ID team. Wrote up for IDKB, see below.

### IDKB

* I needed this for the intern, and information how to resolve as an H5P admin. Wrote up [Installing and Using LaTeX in H5P â€“ IDKB ðŸ¦«](https://idkb.oregonstate.education/knowledge-base/installing-and-using-latex-in-h5p/)
* Added $LaTex$ cheat sheet and usage tips: [LaTeX â€“ IDKB ðŸ¦«](https://idkb.oregonstate.education/knowledge-base/latex/)
* Compiled [Canvas Peer Reviews â€“ IDKB ðŸ¦«](https://idkb.oregonstate.education/knowledge-base/canvas-peer-reviews/) from a ID2ID Slack thread
* Updated [H5P Overview â€“ IDKB ðŸ¦«](https://idkb.oregonstate.education/knowledge-base/h5p-overview/)

### Internship Program

* Internship check-in with Skye. Julie rescheduled for an outpatient surgery.

### OLC Conference

* Setup a new repot for the conference. Worked with Phil and Dana to update Facilitation plan based on dry-run feedback.

### Onboarding New IDs

* Reviewed [ID Employee Onboarding - Asana Template](<https://app.asana.com/0/1205400571207180/12054005> with updated functionality (Timeframe, Owner fields, filters). Suggested have tasks owned by the New Hire based on activities now in the template (install tools, schedule orientation, etc)
* Reviewed

### ID2ID Meeting

* ID2ID demoed a shell script to set up a courses shared folder, shared H5P/LaText info.
* IÂ _think_Â this would work for anyone, except copying the quiz document, which is a hard coded path. The part I think is especially cool is that it downloads the latest Ecampus syllabus and puts it in a syllabus folder.Â (edited)

### Other

* Tested AI Image analysis, both for text extraction and creating Alt Text. Pretty exciting implications for us, particularly for accessibility. Helped me with the Lab conversion for CEM 372.
* Shared some ideas on Socratic teaching and then a bit more on using Canvas for Reflective Journals.
* Was unable to submit a media support ticket for a W24 course. "Custom Support is at maximum capacity for the selected delivery term." I don't think support requests should be blocked, like new media requests. If something is broken, we need to be able to request support and report it.
