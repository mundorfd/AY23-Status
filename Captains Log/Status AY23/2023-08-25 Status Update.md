- planning meeting with Dana

### Faculty Communications Manual

I have set up a GitHub repository to work on the faculty communications documents I have been creating for the course development manual. I would like to keep them private for now, but share it with you. To do this, I hope to add you as a collaborator. If you don't yet have one would you be willing to [Sign up for a GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)? That way I could share links and you could suggest edits. New and updated this week:

- [Embedding Slides and PDFs into Canvas](https://github.com/mundorfd/faculty-comms/blob/main/Embedding%20Slides%20and%20PDFs%20into%20Canvas.md)
- [Lecture Recording Guidance](https://github.com/mundorfd/faculty-comms/blob/main/Lecture%20Recording%20Guidance.md)
- [Alt Text](https://github.com/mundorfd/faculty-comms/blob/main/Alt%20Text.md)

## Course Development Projects

### F23

#### CEM 471

- I am not building this course linearly. I am about halfway through the learning materials pages. They each contain a ton of videos, see [Week 2 - Learning Materials: CEM 471](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1953777/pages/week-2-learning-materials?module_item_id=23423471) for example. My python script took a bit to get working smoothly, but has been a BIG help here. Pulls the video list, titles and embed code or youtube URL from a csv file and generates the html needed for the video grid.
- Updates to week 1â€“4 assignments (correcting point allocations, converting some questions to groups)
- After cleanup and prework (building tables, etc), sent the remaining building tasks for quizzes and three Canvas quiz assignments to student queue. This will take care of the remaining assessments but for two discussions. Especially proud of this table (from an image) that I built: [assignment7 #17: CEM 471](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1953777/pages/assignment7-number-17). Built the florescent lamp in illustrator. Used the perspective grid. 

#### CS 162H

#### SCLM 450/550

- Rohan has made great progress on content delivery. Still needs to develop graduate student project for the cross listed course. He hadn't really accounted for that, but will develop one after we discussed it. Group discussion rubric, Syllabus, Communication Policy and Welcome message for home page still pending.
- I created a discussion rubric for Rohan to use for all individual discussions.
- Moved PowerPoint Slides to current template

#### CEM 

### W24

#### AEC 250

- Converting Week 1 PowerPoints to new template, in progress
- Built question banks and demoed how the [Week 2 - Reading Quiz](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1953586/quizzes/2886028) was developed using question banks built from the selected questions from Ch 3.
- Shared information on CoreEd outcome options with Penny. She will revisit the decision about updated alignment after her CoreEd training.

#### CCE 207

#### CH 332

- Jeff was able to complete the DOC content. Kate had graded it, but I went through it all and starting building some custom banners, hoping to appeal to his willingness to make a thorough Canvas site. See [Week 1 - Overview: CH_322_DEV](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1963511/pages/week-1-overview?module_item_id=23488707) and [Week 3 - Overview: CH_322_DEV](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1963511/pages/week-3-overview?module_item_id=23488717). The banners involved some consultation with my favorite PhD chemistry student, Adobe Stock and some Illustrator tweaks. E.J. was also a big help here. I am converting the overview banners to Illustrator files, making them much easier to work with (gradients, etc). 
- Set up CLOs in all Overview pages to ease build/alignment activities down the road

#### CS 493

- Update meeting with Nauman
- Has week one done and delivered to me
- Sent Slide accessibility guidance
- Setup Media tracking sheet
- was waiting to setup studio site until AI updates implemented

> Please continue to work on content development and recordings. We are slightly behind our target for delivered content. This is ok; you will have more time to work on it now. See [Ecampus Development Milestones](https://oregonstate.box.com/s/wxxw78ujw1mw7mkq0piyimh6fx89cxqa). Please note there is much less flexibility (if any) in the recording deadlines and the final content delivery to me date. Here is your [Media Tracking Spreadsheet](https://oregonstate.box.com/s/29qfxzsawgwk65uelvd24y9epgv1zfee) that we can use to document recordings.
