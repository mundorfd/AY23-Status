# 2023-12-01 Status Update

## Course Development Projects

### W24

#### AEC 250

* Penny wants to include all her lecture slides in the course site but wanted help creating alt text. I don't have the subject matter expertise to alt-text all the graphs, but ChatGPT was doing a decent job getting a starting point. She _was_ willing to edit these if I generated them as a starting point. She had given me 12 slide decks for the first four weeks. I created a [spreadsheet](https://oregonstate.box.com/s/19k6d104n3aybhwd84dlp0zacbpkuy41) with alt text suggestions for the 37 images contained within those slides, until I ran out of ChatGPT 4 credits (I pay for an account but the cap the queries per day)
* Reviewed Media Plan with Penny and the media team. They will continue to get support for content delivered through the end of fall term.
* Built a learning Materials template and then built Weeks 1–6 learning materials pages
* Added OpenStax Self-Check quiz
* updated fillable form for Gradescope Homework Week 1
* Converted several slide decks to new template
* Consulted with ECFS and AT on Gradescope implementation. Complicated since the course won't be offered until some unknown date, so I need to set it up for the studio site.

#### CCE 207

* No activity this week

#### CH 332

* Built Module 1 which I hope to get Jeff's approval on this week so we can move forward on his content.
	* Build Qualtrics Survey to Replicate Study Guide. Tested as a student: [Unit 1 - Week 1 Study Guide](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1963511/assignments/9456226?module_item_id=23809367). I think this might be an interesting way to setup more detailed task lists in Canvas that students can use to track their progress.

	* Setup a Learning Materials Template and built this page in Module 1: [Week 1 - Learning Materials: CH_322_DEV](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1963511/pages/week-1-learning-materials?module_item_id=23488708)
	* Jeff didn't have an introductory discussion, so I built an example one to review with him: [Topic: Week 1 - Discussion](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1963511/discussion_topics/10376478?module_item_id=23488709)
	* Built Homework page. He didn't have any instructions, etc. so I built this information: [Online Homework - Ch. 11 Pt. 1: CH_322_DEV](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1963511/quizzes/2911043?module_item_id=23814914)
	* Jeff will need to select questions from the question banks we have built for the [Week 1 Quiz: CH_322_DEV](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1963511/quizzes/2886444?module_item_id=23488711)
