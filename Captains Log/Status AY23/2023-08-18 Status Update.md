### S23

#### CCE 321

- Most of the media was back for this course so I embedded the 47 newly available lectures and videos. There are still a couple missing. The field trip ones that Jason told Drew not to process, and one other that doesn't look like it was recorded to Matt. Details are here: https://oregonstate.box.com/s/5arqvsdnxwgihs35x088nxfceh9i3icj. I have reached out to Burkan and Jason. I told them that the remaining tasks are waiting for them (updates on the videos, syllabus, communication policy)
- Exported content to shared drive
- Filled out Ecampus Essentials

### F23

#### CEM 471

- Setup a [Padlet Demo](https://padlet.com/mundorfd/considerations-choosing-a-supplier-ctfee0hrqoldsth6) and recruited IDs to be students. Share with Rohan, he is excited about using this tool for students to share criteria for supplier selection, and wanted voting.
- completed overview pages through week 8

I confirmed with Karen that we are ok to be developing to the new outcomes.
