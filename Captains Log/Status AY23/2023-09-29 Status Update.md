## Non-Course Projects

### Faculty Communications Manual

I have set up a GitHub repository to work on the faculty communications documents I have been creating for the course development manual. I would like to keep them private for now, but share it with you. To do this, I hope to add you as a collaborator. If you don't yet have one would you be willing to [Sign up for a GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)? That way I could share links and you could suggest edits. New or updated this week:
