# 2024-01-26 Status Update

## Course Development Projects

### W24

#### AEC 250

* I had difficulties in building interactive homework files for AEC 250 due to missing homework for weeks 4, 5, 6, and 10 in the shared folder, a format change from Word documents to PDF slides from week 7 onward, and a lack of clarity in the structure and student-facing content of the homework assignments. I outlined these issues and sent them to Penny and her grad student. The grad student acknowledged not having provided the right homework files.
* By Monday, January 29, Weeks 4, 6, 7, and 8's homework for AEC 250 were uploaded to their respective weekly content folders on Box for me to use to build the Gradescope assignments.
* Spoke with the media team about pending videos. Support for weekly overview videos has been canceled, and Penny will now do weekly intros via DIY after being given extended deadlines.
* All other recordings are also now complete, Jana expects to be done with these by Friday, February 2.

#### CH 332

This course took quite a bit of my development time this week.

* Updated all "Lecture Video Module" pages (his version of Learning Materials, 1â€“2 a week) with updated video names, chapter readings, and textbook citations for the 8th edition. Example:
	* [Week 4 - LVMs and Textbook Readings](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1963511/pages/week-4-lvms-and-textbook-readings?module_item_id=23488722)
* Fixed Jeff's weekly Study Guide Documents with discussed edits and new names and made them accessible. Built each weekly study guide as a Qualtrics survey that should retain the check state for the students to work through each week. Example:
	* [Week 1 - Study Guide](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1963511/assignments/9522885?module_item_id=23993158)
* Created a [Unit Assessment Overview](- Assessment Overview.,)
* Created five Unit Assessment Study Guides in Canvas. Example:
	* [Unit 3 Assessment Study Guide](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1963511/pages/unit-3-assessment-study-guide)
* Added [Non-Credit Proctorio System Test](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1963511/quizzes/2932565?module_item_id=24081253) to the Unit 1 Assessment module.
* Updated weekly overview pages with Jeff's edits, his module-level outcomes and linked all activities to a "Next Steps" section.
* Made module image files from a free cross-platform molecular editor called [Avogadro](https://avogadro.cc/). The images were used to make custom weekly banners with molecule's Jeff identified. (Demoed this to Marita who thought the molecule image development could be very helpful for CH 123)
* For updates to the overview pages from the previous two bullets, see a couple of examples:
	* [Week 8 - Overview: CH_332_DEV](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1963511/pages/week-8-overview?module_item_id=23488737)
	* [Week 10 - Overview: CH_332_DEV](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1963511/pages/week-10-overview?module_item_id=23488745)

#### CEM 372

* Sent Amalesh [a message](https://app.asana.com/0/1204895037910577/1206470951477357) requesting to meet to wrap up the course; it isn't offered until Spring, but still needs him to provide a Syllabus and a few more items

#### CS 290

#### MAST 201

* I prepped for the intake which we had scheduled for Monday. Lori had to go to Newport. Because of the storm, and instructor travel schedules, I have had difficulty finding a time for Lori to meet with me for intake. She can't until next week. However, since she is an experienced instructor and because I want to get some information from her, I created a [virtual intake survey](https://oregonstate.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_czNGysQKErYe8pU) for her to fill out. I would love input on this!

#### MB 302

* Reviewed Course Analysis worksheet

##### Course Design Activities

See [asana item with captured email](https://app.asana.com/0/1206330558994035/1206395074251976)

As a result, Alina sent back her outline and assignment ideas for the app, allowing me to create a custom app request.
