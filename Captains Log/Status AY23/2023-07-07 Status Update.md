# 2023-07-07 Status Update

## Non-Course Projects

### AI Council

- Developed a list of both general and specific to CLO [AI-Aware STEM ASSIGNMENTS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f2SBu975OERZ_lHXfWExsMJ7i3MIWH5l61mH4sMYCQQ/edit?usp=sharing).

### H5P Admin

- Training with Nick and Akira
- Drafted and revised instructor communication re the new site
- Deployment of SOIL H5P site

### QM Connect

- We were asked to convert the Sr. ID conference proposal to a poster. Given that is the case, I asked if Tianhong and Nadia could share it without me. They were already attending and three for a poster seemed excessive

### Feedback Committee Task Force

- Reviewed responses to faculty survey with team.

## Course Development Projects

### S23

#### CCE 321

- Scheduled review of my feedback and questions for Tuesday, July 11, 2023. Hoping it all goes quickly and we button up everything (media still pending)

### U23

#### AI 534

- Completed media embeds
- Built a supplementary video page
- Designed home page
- Still waiting for PDFs to accompany lectures, at which point we should be abel to run final checks and

#### BHS 255

- Custom media team work complete and added to course. [BHS 255 | Salmonella in the Caribbean](https://web.oregonstate.education/bhs-255-case-study/#/)

#### ME 383

- Embedded the remaining ME 383 Media since it was all returned. Since this course (and the CEM ones I am working on) have so many media embeds, see [Module 8 - Learning Materials: ME_383_DEV](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1928764/pages/module-8-learning-materials) for example, I wrote a python script to help me generate the html for these pages.

### F23

#### CEM 471

- Joe is prioritizing lecture recordings and Sarah has begun processing.

#### CS 162H

- Tim asked me to source and add images to 18 projects hosted on GitHub on this course. Took a while. I got the very effusive "I like the images you picked" via email.
- Worked with Tim on the revision of reflection assignments, consolidated and made the language slightly better (less judgmental). Not as much as I wanted, but better!

#### CS 373

- Bram has focused on his recordings. His production process is complex and he is seeking support from Jana to "consult" on his development in Adobe Premiere that may go beyond what we should expect from an assigned lecture team member. If I read Jason's email about using the MediaHub that Bram received correctly, he is just losing summer support for the intro video.

#### SCLM 450/550

### W24

#### AEC 250

- Penny has shared several OER resources to add to her site.
- Wants a demo I need to prep on Gradescope for paper-based assignments

#### CCE 207

- Intake complete. Joe is behind on his Fall Course. He is trying to catch up and plans on working on this course at that point.
- Discussion re: delivered vs offered. He was hedging on wrapping up on time.

#### CEM 372

- Connected Amalesh with Stefanie, who shared several potential OER materials. At first glance may be too advanced for this course.

#### CH 332

- Joint intake with Kate. Talked to Jeff about the DOC and development process. He is interested in developing some Lightboards (he wrote a grant to get equipment at Cascades), but doesn't want to re-record 70 different videos. He said he is not available to meet with us until after August 14.

### No Activity Last Week

I have check-ins scheduled with these instructors this week.

- CS 493
- NSE 515
