#### CCE 207

* Reviewed development schedule and progress with Joe. Joe has completed all his planned recordings except for one the video team will be shooting with him in January. It is the third in a series of videos on an on-campus construction project. See [CCE 207 - W24 - Video - Asana](https://app.asana.com/0/1204760092812445/1204760172868576)
* Based on the fact that he has most of his recording done, but none of his content delivered, I have put the content at 30%. I hope to get to the build soon, but need content first. We discussed some "templates" I could create for Overview Pages and weekly reflection assignments. I also thought I could help with a rubric for the reflection assignments.

#### CH 332

* After meeting with Jeff, I worked on quizzes for CH 322. Big migration project moving several hundred questions from quizzes into question banks with a specific naming convention. After suggesting a naming convention, documenting his instructions, and getting the criteria of which quizzes to use, I created a Student Asana Task to help with this project: [CH 332 - W24: Convert Quiz Questions to Question Banks - Asana](https://app.asana.com/0/1204909280946840/1205683250189952)

### Internship Program

* Scheduled and prepped for Intern Orientation Meetings
* Reached out to Intern mentors, to follow up on their initial meetings, and any thoughts they had about the type of support the interns would need
* Completed, signed, and submitted AHE Learning Agreements for Skye and Julie. [Stevie Wonder - Signed, Sealed, Delivered](https://youtu.be/WvRwR-hZDVY?si=2sCXc61ouPQkUoZ9)
* Spoke with AHE about extra opportunities for interns. Kate wanted to invite Skye to a media shoot, I like to invite them to things like Research Community and Media Showcase. These are optional activities, and particularly with Skye, limited to 3 hours a week, didn't want to offer if those would be counted against that time. Becky said Skye could log the extra hours and bank them toward a future internship credit. Shared with both Skye and Julie. I have added this note to my ID Orientation agenda for the future.

### OLC Conference

* Wrote bio and added image to OLC profile
