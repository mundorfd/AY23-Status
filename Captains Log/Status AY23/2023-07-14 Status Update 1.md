- I embedded the media I could and added a column for ID Notes to the [CCE 321 Media Tracking Sheet](https://oregonstate.box.com/s/5arqvsdnxwgihs35x088nxfceh9i3icj). Some videos I could not find, and some had access issues.

Drew sent Jason a note to Jason requesting video edit notes the footage for the video shot last summer. In response, Jason said he would edit them himself. Not sure, then when I will get them to embed.

#### SOC 481

- During delivery a problem was identified with the way a staged individual assignment was set up. It took me around 3.5 hours to understand the issue and resolve it, with Katherine's help. The write up is here: [Instructor Information About the Video Presentations: SOCIETY AND NATURAL RESOURCES (SOC_481_400_U2023)](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1926140/pages/instructor-information-about-the-video-presentations?module_item_id=23439050). Essentially, I had setup a structure in Canvas meant to give class members different due dates to the same assignments in a staged project. I leveraged Canvas Groups to do this, and it didn't work as expected. The end results was having to manually resubmit the assignments for five students. The remaining students and assignments have been fixed.
